===============

Register captive audiences for raffles. Think conferences and hack-a-thons.

1. Set up an event and decide how many raffles you will have.
2. Print out a bunch of QR codes to stick to the attendees.
3. Scan the code and have them hand over all their relevant information.
4. Scan the code whenever there is a new raffle for a new entry.
5. Give out prizes.


##Possible Improvements
* Email all entrants the winner of the latest raffle
* Specify the prize for the raffles upfront to be included in the raffle notification email.
* Better support for using the app before or after an event ends.
* Better UI.


##Development
Scaffolded by the Trevi gem
